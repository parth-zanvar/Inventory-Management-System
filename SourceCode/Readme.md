# To run the program

## Requirements to run this program

+ The only requirement is python. Python must be installed on the device. There are no database software requirements as we have used sqlite3 to manage database and it comes preinstalled with python.
+ Please download both files, i.e., the InventoryManagement.py file and the Inventory.db file and place both in same directory. Then use IDLE or PyCharm or any other IDE for python to run the program.
